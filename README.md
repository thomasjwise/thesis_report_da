## Purpose 

This archive provides the script and analytical tools for reproducing the project: *Evaluating Machine Learning Techniques for Early PTSD Prognosis after Trauma using synthetic data*. This project presents as the thesis project for Thomas J Wise, on the programme Methodology and Statistics for the Biomedical, Behavioural and Social Sciences at Utrecht University. 

For the purpose of data confidentiality the original data (presented by Mouthaan et al., 2014), is not included, however the synthetic data generated and the methodology for generation is detailed.
